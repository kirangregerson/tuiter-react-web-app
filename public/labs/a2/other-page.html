<p>first day as a second century warlord i have my men tie branches to their horses' tails to stir up dust and make it
    look like there's a lot of us but i forget it just rained so there isn't any dust and the enemy can clearly see there's
    like twenty of us all spread out in a line</p>

<p>second day as a second century warlord i bribe a bunch of kids to start singing a nursery rhyme i carefully crafted to
    spread misinformation and further my strategic ends but they change the lyrics to be about poop and the enemy isn't
    misdirected at all</p>

<p>third day as a second century warlord i lure my enemy into a narrow valley and send a team of archers to shoot them
    from the high ground but there was a feral hog napping on the trail up to the overlook and they couldn't decide whether
    to try and shoot it or just go around and by the time the hog woke up and left on its own the enemy had already passed
    safely below</p>

<p>fourth day as a second century warlord we attempt to join a battle on the side of the guy we want to ally with but he
    and the guy he's fighting have really similar names and it's finally dusty and i misread the standards and attack the
    wrong guy. so now we're stuck with this total loser of a liege lord, because how the fuck do you explain that after a
    battle?</p>

<p>fifth day as a second century warlord and some sort of wizard wanders into camp, my loser liege lord wants to execute
    him for being a wizard but i convince him to let the wizard stay, because i want to do more weather-based strategies
    and i'm pretty sure having a camp wizard can help with that. after the welcome to the team banquet the wizard steals
    half the treasury and my liege lord's wife and leaves</p>

<p>sixth day as a second century warlord my loser liege lord sends me to reinforce a city he's taken, but in the confusion
    of leaving i forgot to take the token that would have gotten us into the city, so my men have to wait outside the city
    walls for like eight hours while i ride back to get it</p>

<p>seventh day as a second century warlord and my loser liege lord finally joins me in the city, it turns out he's actually
    a pretty cool guy, and he isn't even that mad at me for letting the wizard steal his wife. i decide to shoot my shot but
    i'm really nervous and keep on stalling because what if i mess up our relationship and by extension jeopardize the
    security of my men, and eventually he just says goodnight and goes back to his room, where an assassin is in the process
    of setting up to kill him</p>

<p>eighth day as a second century warlord and my loser liege lord tells me to fake defect to his rival warlord, the one i
    originally wanted to ally with, to find out if he was the one who sent the assassin and why. but my whole way over to
    the rival warlord i'm worried that this has something to do with the wizard thing or how awkward i made it last night</p>

<p>ninth day as a second century warlord i try to tactfully ask my fake liege lord if he sent the assassin to kill my loser
    liege lord and it turns out the idea of using assassins never occurred to him, but now that i've suggested it he's
    really into it. in order to save my loser liege lord i volunteer to be the one to kill him</p>

<p>tenth day as a second century warlord on my way back to my loser liege lord's city i realize i won't be able to collect
    my men from my fake liege lord until i bring back my loser liege lord's head. this would have been a great thing to
    think of before i got myself in this situation. i go back to my loser liege lord and ask him to rescue my men, and he
    tells me that if he could sack my fake liege lord's camp he already would have. that doesn't change the fact that my
    men are still trapped. they're prisoners, even. i go back to my room to sulk</p>

<p>eleventh day as a second century warlord i find a little caged pigeon in the rafters of my loser liege lord's room and
    deduce it belonged to the assassin. without asking permission or telling my loser liege lord goodbye i let the pigeon
    loose and follow it north. don't ask what i was doing in my loser liege lord's room. it's not important</p>

<p>twelfth day as a second century warlord i disguise myself as a wizard and enter the camp of the coalition leader the
    pigeon led me to. in the middle of my little sleight of hand performance i make eye contact with the coalition leader's
    second-in-command. IT'S THE WIZARD THAT STOLE MY LOSER LIEGE LORD'S WIFE. after the banquet i corner the fake wizard
    and ask him what the fuck is going on and he just says "wouldn't you like to know" and leaves. i don't know what to say
    to that so i just let him go</p>

<p>thirteenth day as a second century warlord i'm honestly so sick of not knowing what's going on, so i adjust my wizard
    costume to passably disguise myself as a woman and break into the women's area of the camp, where sure enough my loser
    liege lord's wife is. i ask her what she's doing here and she tells me the fake wizard overheard her singing a poem she
    overheard on the street, not knowing it contains the coalition leader's formation's weaknesses. the fake wizard
    kidnapped her and assigned an assassin to kill her husband before they figured out the poem's significance. she shares
    the first couplet with me but i'm discovered and thrown out before she can share any more. she doesn't need to. through
    a bizarre coincidence of homophones, it's the poop version of my misinformation nursery rhyme</p>

<p>fourteenth day as a second century warlord i go back to my loser liege lord and tell him everything, urging him to
    join with my fake liege lord to attack the coalition leader according to the weaknesses in the nursery rhyme. he tells
    me frankly that he doesn't trust me anymore. i ask him to execute me if that's really true, because i can't bear to
    live if i can't protect him and i can't protect my men. he agrees to attack the coalition leader</p>

<p>fifteenth day as a second century warlord. due to the information in the nursery rhyme, and thanks to my loser liege
    lord reminding me of the weather conditions multiple times while planning our battle strategy, our alliance carries the
    day. my loser liege lord gets his wife back. my men tell me that our fake liege lord actually treated them really well
    and they'd like to stay with him if i don't mind. i do mind, now that neither the men i love nor the man i love have
    any use for me, but i don't tell them that</p>

<p>sixteenth day as a second century warlord i'm preparing to leave to i don't know where, maybe to try to become a wizard
    for real, when my loser liege lord stops me and asks me where i'm going. he says he had hoped i would continue to work
    as his advisor. i was unaware i was his advisor in the first place. i agree, and he tells me he's truly honored to have
    me in his service at last. he has known i am a rare and talented man with a strategic intelligence far above his ever
    since the day he witnessed me tying branches to my horses' tails in six inches of mud, and could not for the life of
    him figure out why</p>
